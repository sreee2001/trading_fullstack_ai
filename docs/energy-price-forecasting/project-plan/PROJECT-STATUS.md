## 🚦 Current Status: **AWAITING YOUR APPROVAL**

### **Please Review:**
📄 **Document**: `docs/energy-price-forecasting/project-plan/01-high-level-features-proposal.md`

### **Questions for You:**

1. **Scope Decision**: 
   - Should we implement all 8 features, or focus on core features (1-5) first?
   - Recommendation: Start with core features for MVP

2. **Technology Preferences**:
   - TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning?
   - Recommendation: PyTorch (more flexible, research-friendly)

3. **Commodity Focus**:
   - Start with WTI Crude Oil only, or multiple commodities?
   - Recommendation: Start with WTI, add others later

4. **Dashboard Priority**:
   - Full React dashboard from start, or simple visualization first?
   - Recommendation: Simple visualization (Matplotlib) first, React dashboard later

5. **Deployment Target**:
   - AWS, Azure, local Docker, or simple hosting?
   - Recommendation: Docker containers for portability

## 📅 Next Steps (After Approval)

Once you approve the features, I will:

1. ✅ **Create Epic Breakdown** - Organize features into implementation chunks
2. ✅ **Create Feature Breakdown** - Detail each Epic into specific features
3. ✅ **Create Tracker Table** - Self-updating progress tracker
4. ✅ **Create User Stories** - Detailed stories with acceptance criteria
5. ✅ **Get Story Approval** - Wait for your review before implementation
6. ✅ **Start Implementation** - Begin coding in priority order
